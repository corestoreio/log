Package log contains BlackHole, StdLog, Log15 and the Logger interface.

Logging

Interface Logger is used all over the place and there are no other dependencies.
Default Logger is a null logger. You must take care to implement a logger which
is also thread safe.

Convention: Because recording a human-meaningful message is common and good
practice, the first argument to every logging method is the value to the
*implicit* key 'msg'. You may supply any additional context as a set of
key/value pairs to the logging function.

Level guards exists to avoid the cost of building arguments. Get in the
habit of using guards.

	import "github.com/corestoreio/log"

	if log.IsDebug() {
		log.Debug("some message", log.Object("key1", expensive()))
	}

Standardizes on key-value pair argument sequence:

	import "github.com/corestoreio/log"

	log.Debug("message from inside Fn()", log.String("key1", "value1"), log.Int64("key2", 42))

	// instead of this
	log.WithFields(logrus.Fields{"m": "pkg", "key1": value1, "key2": value2}).Debug("inside fn()")

Please consider the key-value pairs when implementing your own logger.

Recommended Loggers are https://github.com/mgutz/logxi and https://github.com/Sirupsen/logrus
and https://github.com/inconshreveable/log15

Standard Logger

CoreStore provides a leveled logger based on Go's standard library without any
dependencies. This StdLog obeys to the interface Logger of this package.

	import "github.com/corestoreio/log"

	std := log.NewStdLog(log.SetStdLevel(log.StdLevelDebug))

log.NewStdLog() accepts a wide range of optional arguments. Please see the functions Std*Option().
